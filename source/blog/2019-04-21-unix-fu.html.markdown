I will record some UNIX commands and useful things here.

# Environment Variables
* to view them use `printenv`. Might be useful to pipe the output into less`printenv | less`
* to set an environment variable `export var=value`. For example `export TMP=~/mytempfolder`

# Handy commands
`tree -C <dir-name>` to print out the contents of a directory in a very clear way.

# Stuff I always forget

File permissions, this picture clears up everything for me:

![UNIX permissions] (/images/blog/unix-fu/unix-permissions.jpeg)

Owner, then group then other users. The first character, shows if its a directory or not.
If you want to change permissions there are several ways to go about it:

```bash
chmod g-w <filename>
```

# AWESOMENESS
`https://github.com/clvv/fasd` ---> go to directories fast and easy
`jq` ---->> nice formating for json api calls (think curl)
