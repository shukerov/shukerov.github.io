     <span id="hello-text">Hello,</span>
     <p class='index-text'>my name is Stoyan. I was born and raised in Bulgaria. I moved to the states in 2013 to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science.<p>
     <p class= 'index-text'>I graduated from California Polytechnic State University a month ago. I am on a quest to become a better software developer, and have as much fun as possible while doing so.</p>
     <p class="current">Recently, I have been working on <a href='https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme' target='_blank'>dataforme.xyz</a>.</p>
    <p id="highlight"> About this website </p>
    <p> This website was created mainly for practice, and documentation. I tend to remember things better when I write about them.</p>
    <p> Here you will mainly find blog posts about technologies I use, and configurations for my machine.</p>
